- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") 
- To test out and experiment what I can and cannot do with my current limited knowldge; as well as to asses what I could do in the future.
- What problem does it solve? 
- Coming in with 0 background in coding, this has helped build a small base off which I can work from, expand, and add more.
- What did you learn?
- i learned  

## Installation

- N/A
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

- This prework study guide is tailored to the UCD coding bootcamp. It was meant as way to allow all the participating students to start the class on an equal footing. 
- It can be used as reference to basics, the content is not extensive, it's rather very rudimentary. It was derived by what the modules taught us, therefore the topics and details listed are geared towards that. So if it feels like other core values or detailed were neglected, that could be the reason. It's important to keep in mind that 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
