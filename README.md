## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
To learn the very basics of coding, in order to start the bootcamp on an equal footing with the rest of my classmates. 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") 
To test out and experiment what I can and cannot do with my current limited knowldge; as well as to asses what I could do in the future.
- What problem does it solve? 
Coming in with 0 background in coding, this has helped build a small base off which I can work from, expand, and add more.
- What did you learn?
I learned an example of how a coder works. Being introduced to Github put a persective of how things are likely to look like when you get a job.
By creating a website, I was able to learn the basics of how HTML, CSS and JS come together. It's not a complex website by any means, so there is a lot of room for improvement and growth, but it was a good introduction of what's yet to come.

## Usage

- This prework study guide is tailored to the UCD coding bootcamp. It was meant as way to allow all the participating students to start the class on an equal footing. 
- It can be used as reference to basics (HTML, CSS, JS, and  Github), the content is not extensive, it's rather very rudimentary. It was derived by what the prework modules taught us, therefore the topics and details listed are geared towards that. If it feels like other core values or details were overlooked or neglected, that could be the reason. It's also important to keep in mind that it is was also filtered through to what I deemed was important.
- Although it was catered to the UCD bootcamp, if other people come across it, they can use it as a guiding tool and determine what is a good starting point. However, the header element did not contain the words ""coding, or "learning how to code", therefore it's highly unlikely that they will come across this page as it would not show up in the search engines.
